# snake
Classical snake game writen in C around 2001, when I was in highschool, using the Borland C++ 3.1 editor and some VGA graphics driver.

Execute the SNAKE.EXE file using DOSBox (https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/) after you mount your drive inside DOS ( 'mount C C:/').

Inside the main menu:
- press 's' to start
- press 'n' for the sound control
- press 'm' to see max score
- press 'u' to change player name
- press 'x' to exit

Text is writtten in Romanian, accepting translations :)

And if you are able to compile it, let me know!
